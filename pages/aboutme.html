          <h4> My Past </h4>
          <p>I was born in Nairobi, Kenya on December 17, 1990. My father is a doctor and my mother works intelligence for the government. At the age of three my brother mother and I moved to D.C for better education. My father remained in Nairobi. Since then I have spent my schol years in America, and my summers in Kenya. I feel blessed to have lived such a diverse life, and I take pride in giving back to the community. </p>
        <br />

          <h4> Web Development </h4>
          <p> My journey into web development is traced back to when I graduated college. Immediately following graduation, I went to visit my father in Kenya, and ended up climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro. It was at this moment that I knew I wanted to live by the mountains. I came back to the states packed up my bags, and moved to Colorado. I intended to spend the next two years working in physical rehabilitation and fitness before going to grad school. One of my clients at the time happened to be a web developer. Having always had a curiousity for technology I began asking him questions about it. It started off as a hobby, I had no intention of pursuing it full time. However, eventually I found that I enjoyed Web Development more than I enjoyed rehabilitation. This led me to take the full plunge and pursue an immersive Full Stack bootcamp at Galvanize.

          <h4> My Future </h4>
          <p> My goal is to find the company that sees the same potential in me, that I see in myself. I thrive in new technologies and want to be exposed to a wide range of tasks. Ideally I will be in a Full Stack or Back-end position. TDD is a must, as well as solid mentorship. I thrive around people, and I am very confident that I will have a positive impact at whatever company I end up at. </p>
